## Research Foundation and Mathematical Basis

### 1. Isolation Forest Algorithm - Core Anomaly Detection

**Mathematical Foundation:**
Based on Liu et al.'s original work and enhanced by recent 2024-2025 research, Isolation Forest operates on the principle that anomalies are few and different, requiring fewer random cuts to isolate.

**Key Research Sources:**
- **"Enhanced Banking Security: Isolation Forest with Attention Mechanism for Sophisticated Fraud Detection"** (2024) - ResearchGate publication showing IForest-ATM outperforms current algorithms
- **"A probabilistic approach driven credit card anomaly detection with CBLOF and isolation forest models"** (ScienceDirect, 2025)
- **"Performance Analysis of Isolation Forest Algorithm in Fraud Detection of Credit Card Transactions"** (ResearchGate, 2024)

**Mathematical Model:**
```
Anomaly Score = 2^(-E(h(x))/c(n))

Where:
- E(h(x)) = average path length of point x over all trees
- c(n) = average path length of unsuccessful search in BST with n points
- c(n) = 2H(n-1) - (2(n-1)/n)
- H(i) = ln(i) + γ (harmonic number)
```

**Performance Metrics from Research:**
- 98% detection rate with 0.01% false positive rate (2024 IEEE study)
- O(n log n) time complexity for real-time processing
- Handles high-dimensional data efficiently

### 2. XGBoost Ensemble Methods

**Mathematical Foundation:**
Extreme Gradient Boosting uses second-order Taylor expansion for loss function optimization, enabling superior performance in imbalanced fraud datasets.

**Key Research Sources:**
- **"Financial Fraud Detection Using Explainable AI and Stacking Ensemble Methods"** (ArXiv, 2025)
- **"A Powerful Predicting Model for Financial Statement Fraud Based on Optimized XGBoost Ensemble Learning Technique"** (MDPI, 2024)
- **"Optimizing Credit Card Fraud Detection: Random Forest and XGBoost Ensemble"** (ResearchGate, 2024)

**Mathematical Model:**
```
Objective Function:
L(t) = Σ[l(yi, ŷi^(t-1) + ft(xi))] + Ω(ft)

Where:
- l = loss function
- Ω(ft) = γT + (1/2)λ||w||² (regularization)
- ft(xi) = wq(xi) (tree structure with leaf weights)
```

**Performance Achievements:**
- 96.05% accuracy in financial statement fraud detection (2024 research)
- AUC of 1.00 and F1-scores of 0.92 with stacking ensembles
- Superior performance over Random Forest and traditional methods

### 3. Behavioral Biometrics - Keystroke Dynamics

**Mathematical Foundation:**
Keystroke dynamics analysis using Gaussian Mixture Models, Mahalanobis Distance, and deep learning architectures for behavioral pattern recognition.

**Key Research Sources:**
- **"Diagnosing Parkinson's disease via behavioral biometrics of keystroke dynamics"** (Science Advances, 2025)
- **"The Improved Biometric Identification of Keystroke Dynamics Based on Deep Learning Approaches"** (Sensors, June 2024)
- **"A Review of Several Keystroke Dynamics Methods"** (ArXiv, February 2025)

**Mathematical Models:**

*Keystroke Features:*
- **Dwell Time**: td = release_time - press_time
- **Flight Time**: tf = press_time(i+1) - release_time(i)
- **Typing Rhythm**: Statistical features (mean, std, median) of timing patterns

*Mahalanobis Distance Classification:*
```
MD(x) = √[(x - μ)ᵀΣ⁻¹(x - μ)]

Where:
- x = feature vector
- μ = mean vector of user profile
- Σ = covariance matrix
```

*Gaussian Mixture Model:*
```
P(x|θ) = Σ(k=1 to K) πk N(x|μk, Σk)

Where:
- πk = mixing weights
- N(x|μk, Σk) = Gaussian components
```

**Performance Metrics:**
- >95% authentication accuracy with deep learning approaches (2024)
- Real-time processing capability for continuous authentication
- Robust against spoofing attempts with multi-feature analysis

### 4. Graph Neural Networks for Fraud Ring Detection

**Mathematical Foundation:**
GNNs leverage graph structure to capture complex relational patterns in financial networks, enabling detection of coordinated fraud attacks and money laundering schemes.

**Key Research Sources:**
- **"Graph Neural Networks for Financial Fraud Detection: A Review"** (ArXiv, November 2024)
- **"Financial fraud detection using graph neural networks: A systematic review"** (Expert Systems with Applications, 2024)
- **"AI-Powered Fraud Detection in Financial Services: GNN, Compliance Challenges, and Risk Mitigation"** (SSRN, March 2025)

**Mathematical Model:**

*Graph Convolution:*
```
H^(l+1) = σ(D̃^(-1/2)ÃD̃^(-1/2)H^(l)W^(l))

Where:
- Ã = A + I (adjacency matrix with self-loops)
- D̃ = degree matrix
- H^(l) = node features at layer l
- W^(l) = learnable weight matrix
```

*Graph Attention Network:*
```
αij = softmax(LeakyReLU(aᵀ[Whi||Whj]))
hi' = σ(Σ(j∈Ni) αijWhj)

Where:
- αij = attention weights
- a = attention mechanism
- || = concatenation
```

**Performance Achievements:**
- Superior recall and detection accuracy vs Random Forest and XGBoost
- Effective identification of fraud gangs and synthetic identity fraud
- Scalable to networks with millions of nodes and edges
