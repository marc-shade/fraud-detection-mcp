class FraudDetector:
    """Advanced fraud detection using machine learning."""

    def __init__(self, model_config: Dict[str, any]) -> None:
        """Initialize fraud detector with configuration."""
        self.config = model_config
        self.model: Optional[BaseModel] = None

    def analyze_transaction(
        self,
        transaction_data: Dict[str, any],
        behavioral_data: Optional[Dict[str, any]] = None
    ) -> Dict[str, any]:
        """Analyze transaction for fraud indicators.

        Args:
            transaction_data: Transaction details
            behavioral_data: Optional behavioral biometrics

        Returns:
            Analysis results with risk score and explanation
        """
